    # Problem Statement
    st.write("## Problem Statement:")
    st.write(""" 
    In today’s fast-paced retail environment, ensuring product quality and freshness is crucial for customer satisfaction. The Flipkart GrID 6.0 Challenge aims to address this issue by leveraging technology to enhance product packaging analysis and freshness detection. 

    Traditional methods of checking freshness often involve manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Furthermore, with the increasing variety of products available, a more automated and reliable solution is needed to streamline this process.

    Our project focuses on developing an advanced system that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image recognition techniques to automate the extraction of product details from packaging. This will not only improve accuracy but also increase efficiency in assessing product freshness.
    """)

    # Proposed Solution
    st.write("## Proposed Solution:")
    st.write(""" 
    Our solution is designed to tackle the problem by implementing the following key components:

    ### 1. OCR for Product Detail Extraction
    We will use OCR technology to accurately extract critical information from product packaging, including:
    - Brand name
    - Pack size
    - Expiry date
    - MRP details

    This will allow for real-time analysis of product information, ensuring that customers receive accurate data about their purchases.

    ### 2. Freshness Detection using Image Recognition
    In conjunction with OCR, our model will utilize image recognition to assess the freshness of fruits, vegetables, and other perishable items. The model will be trained to classify products based on their appearance, detecting signs of spoilage and degradation. 

    ### 3. Data Validation and Reporting
    Our system will not only extract data but also validate expiry dates against the current date to ensure product safety. The results will be compiled into a user-friendly report that can be easily interpreted by retail staff.

    ### 4. Video Simulation
    To effectively demonstrate our solution, we will create a video simulation showcasing the functionality of our system. This will include real-time examples of how our model processes images and extracts relevant information.

    ### 5. Proposal Submission
    As part of the proposal round, we will provide a comprehensive submission outlining our approach, methodology, and the code developed thus far. This submission will highlight the effectiveness of our solution and our readiness to proceed to the final stage of the challenge.
    
    Our team is committed to delivering a robust solution that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of the Flipkart GrID 6.0 Challenge.
